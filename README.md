# MicroAI Repository

Welcome to the MicroAI repository! ü§ñ This project aims to provide minimal implementations ‚öíÔ∏è of influential papers üìú in the field of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). 

The implementations are designed to be concise yet illustrative, focusing on key concepts across various subareas, including computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, graph machine learning, etc.

**Note**: this repository is a constant work in progress, new implementations will be added as time permits üèóÔ∏è
